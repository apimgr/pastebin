# Project SPEC

Project: PASTEBIN
Role: Efficient loader for AI.md

⚠️ **THIS FILE IS AUTO-LOADED EVERY CONVERSATION. FOLLOW IT EXACTLY.** ⚠️

Purpose:
- This file is a short loader for the most important rules
- `AI.md` is the full source of truth
- For complete details, read the referenced PARTs in `AI.md`

## Asking Questions

- **Default to continuing work** - do not stop just to ask whether you should continue; if the next step is implied by the spec, the current task, or the current findings, continue
- **Never guess** - if the answer cannot be determined from `AI.md`, `IDEA.md`, the codebase, or repo state **and** the missing information materially changes behavior, scope, or safety, ASK the user
- **Do NOT ask for permission to keep going** - continue until the current task is complete, blocked by a real decision, or the user explicitly asks to pause
- **Question mark = question** - when user ends with `?`, answer/clarify, don't execute

**Ask only when at least one of these is true:**
1. A required business/product decision is missing
2. Two or more reasonable implementations would produce materially different behavior
3. The action is destructive, irreversible, or impacts production/user data
4. The spec explicitly says to ask or confirm
5. The user explicitly requested a plan, pause, or checkpoint before execution

## Before ANY Code Change

1. Have I read the relevant PART in AI.md? (If no → read it)
2. Does this follow the spec EXACTLY? (If unsure → check spec)
3. Am I guessing or do I KNOW from the spec? (If guessing → read spec)
4. Would this pass the compliance checklist? (AI.md FINAL section)

**WHEN IN DOUBT: READ THE SPEC. DO NOT GUESS.**

## Binary Terminology
- **server** = `pastebin` (main binary, runs as service)
- **client** = `pastebin-cli` (REQUIRED companion, CLI/TUI/GUI)

## Key Placeholders
- `{project_name}` = pastebin
- `{project_org}` = apimgr
- `{internal_name}` = pastebin (FROZEN)

## NEVER Do (Top 19) - VIOLATIONS ARE BUGS
1. Use bcrypt for config/backup passwords → Use Argon2id
2. Put Dockerfile in root → `docker/Dockerfile`
3. Use CGO → CGO_ENABLED=0 always
4. Hardcode dev values → Detect at runtime
5. Use external cron → Internal scheduler (PART 18)
6. Store config/backup passwords plaintext → Argon2id (API tokens use SHA-256)
7. Create premium tiers → All features free, no paywalls
8. Use Makefile in CI/CD → Explicit commands only
9. Guess values a command can produce → Run the command
10. Skip platforms → Build all 8 (linux/darwin/windows/freebsd × amd64/arm64)
11. Client-side rendering (React/Vue) → Server-side Go templates
12. Require JavaScript for core features → Progressive enhancement only
13. Let long strings break mobile → Use word-break CSS
14. Skip validation → Server validates EVERYTHING
15. Implement without reading spec → Read relevant PART first
16. Modify AI.md content → READ-ONLY SPEC
17. Edit `## Project variables` in IDEA.md without confirming with user
18. Read image > 1000×1000 directly → Resize first
19. Use non-conforming IDEA.md → Migrate it first

## ALWAYS Do - NON-NEGOTIABLE
1. Read AI.md before implementing ANY feature
2. Server-side processing (server does the work, client displays)
3. Mobile-first responsive CSS
4. All features work without JavaScript
5. Tor hidden service support (auto-enabled if Tor found)
6. Built-in scheduler, GeoIP, metrics, email, backup, update
7. All settings configurable via API and config file
8. Client binary for ALL projects
9. Commit via `gitcommit --dir {dir} all`

## File Locations
- Config: `/etc/apimgr/pastebin/server.yml`
- Data: `/var/lib/apimgr/pastebin/`
- Logs: `/var/log/apimgr/pastebin/`
- Source: `src/`
- Docker: `docker/`

## Where to Find Details
- AI behavior: `.claude/rules/ai-rules.md` (PART 0, 1)
- Project structure: `.claude/rules/project-rules.md` (PART 2, 3, 4)
- Frontend/WebUI: `.claude/rules/frontend-rules.md` (PART 16)
- Full spec: `AI.md` (~55k lines) ← **SOURCE OF TRUTH**

## Current Project State
[AI updates this section as work progresses]
- Last read AI.md: 2026-06-11
- Current task: bootstrapping
- Relevant PARTs: 0-6
