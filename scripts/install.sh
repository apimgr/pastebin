# mktemp: predictable shared paths like /tmp/pastebin are a symlink/hijack

# required, not decorative: mktemp creates the final file but NOT the
# intervening directory, so without it a fresh machine fails with
# "No such file or directory" before anything is downloaded. This is the
# project's documented temp-dir convention (AI.md 32750-32751).
